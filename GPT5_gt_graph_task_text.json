Minor blood loss expected; postoperative course likely routine.\n\nFinal concise statement for Task3\nProceed with precise, gallbladder-side dissection to fully clear Calot’s triangle, control oozing, detach the lower third of the gallbladder, and confirm CVS before clipping and dividing. If anatomy remains uncertain, pause and adopt a bail-out rather than deepen toward the bile duct; prognosis is favorable for laparoscopic completion without complications."

Mild thermal charring adjacent to the infundibulum/cystic plate from cautery. No clear wall thickening. No adhesions seen to surrounding organs in this frame. Small surface fluid sheen present; no active bleeding.\n  - Calot’s (hepatocystic) triangle (node1): Areolar/fibrofatty tissue has been widely cleared.

Visualization and hemostasis should be optimized throughout; with these steps, laparoscopic completion is expected with low complication risk."

    "Task2": "[Task2] Insight — step-by-step reasoning\n- Surgical context (phase/step/state):\n  - Phase: Dissection phase to obtain the Critical View of Safety.\n  - Step: Clearing Calot’s triangle and skeletonizing the cystic duct/artery; partial detachment from cystic plate is underway.\n  - State: Incomplete CVS; ongoing tissue clearance with mild inflammatory changes and minor bleeding.\n\n- Clinical interpretation (patient safety and progression):\n  - Anatomy is not fully defined; the cystic artery is not yet identified, and posterior window is not demonstrated, so division of any structure now would be unsafe.\n  - Minor oozing slightly degrades visualization; careful hemostasis and continued lateral-to-medial, close-to-gallbladder dissection are required to reduce bile duct injury risk.\n  - Overall progression is appropriate but at an intermediate stage; safety hinges on achieving full CVS before clipping/division.\n\nFinal concise statement (Task2):\nThis frame shows mid-dissection of Calot’s triangle with partial cystic duct skeletonization and incomplete exposure, consistent with working toward the Critical View of Safety. Proceeding to clip or divide any structure now would be premature; careful continuation to fully clear the triangle and detach the lower gallbladder is needed to minimize misidentification risk.\nBDI_RISK_LEVEL=3",
    "Task3": "[Task3] Future Plan and Outcome Prediction — step-by-step reasoning\n- Key points of caution/avoidance:\n  - Do not clip or divide until full CVS is obtained.\n  - Keep dissection on the gallbladder side; avoid medial/deep dissection toward the common/hepatic ducts.\n  - Orient the hook so energy is directed away from the duct; use low-power, short bursts.\n  - Control oozing promptly to maintain a clean field.\n  - Create both anterior and posterior windows around the cystic duct and identify the cystic artery clearly.\n  - If anatomy remains unclear, consider IOC and/or bail-out strategies (fundus-first or subtotal).\n\n- Detailed action plan (what, how, intent):\n  1) Optimize traction: maintain strong lateral/inferior pull on the infundibulum; if available, add cephalad fundus retraction to open the triangle.\n  2) Anterior peritoneal clearance: use hook cautery with gentle sweeping from lateral to medial, staying close to the gallbladder neck; coagulate small bleeders.\n  3) Posterior dissection: elevate the infundibulum and clear the posterior leaflet to create a posterior window; avoid deep medial bites.\n  4) Circumferential skeletonization: define the cystic duct fully and identify the cystic artery as a separate tubular structure entering the gallbladder.\n  5) Detach lower third of gallbladder from the cystic plate to expose liver bed clearly.\n  6) Confirm CVS (two and only two structures, cleared triangle, lower GB off liver) visually and on video.\n  7) Clip/divide sequence: typically clip and divide the cystic artery first, then the cystic duct; consider IOC if any doubt persists.\n  8) Complete cholecystectomy off the liver bed, achieve hemostasis, irrigate, and inspect for bile leak.\n\n- Predicted surgical outcome:\n  - With these steps and given only mild–moderate inflammation, high likelihood of safe laparoscopic completion without bile duct injury or conversion. Minor blood loss expected; low risk of bile leak if CVS is respected.\n\nFinal concise statement (Task3):\nProceed with meticulous lateral-to-medial dissection close to the gallbladder, clear both anterior and posterior planes to skeletonize the cystic duct and identify the cystic artery, and detach the lower third of the gallbladder before any clipping. Maintain hemostasis and avoid thermal spread toward the main bile duct; use IOC or bail-out strategies if anatomy remains uncertain. Expected outcome is uneventful laparoscopic completion with low complication risk."
