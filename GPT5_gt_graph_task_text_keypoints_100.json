The lower gallbladder-cystic plate interface is only partially separated in this view.",
    "Task2_Final": "The operation is in the Calot’s dissection phase with the cystic duct and artery largely skeletonized and the triangle opened. Completion of cystic plate separation is needed to finalize CVS before clipping/division; current visualization is adequate but inflammation and minor oozing warrant cautious, gallbladder-side dissection.",

After confirming CVS, clip/divide the artery then the duct and complete the cholecystectomy, with bailout options considered only if CVS cannot be secured; prognosis for laparoscopic completion is favorable."

Anatomy is not yet safely defined; further controlled dissection on the gallbladder side or a bail-out strategy will be required to mitigate bile duct injury risk.",

A laparoscopic completion is likely, though a subtotal and selective drainage may be required in view of inflammation and the infundibular opening."

Overall progression is acceptable, but careful identification is needed to minimize bile duct injury risk.",
