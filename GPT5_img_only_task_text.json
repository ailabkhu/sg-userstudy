With adherence to safety steps, major complications are unlikely; minor bile leak risk exists.\n\nFinal concise statement (Task3):\nProceed with decompression, meticulous close-to-gallbladder peritoneal dissection, and attempt CVS; if unsafe, convert to fundus-first or subtotal cholecystectomy rather than risking hilar injury, with liberal suction/irrigation for any spillage. Outcome is likely successful laparoscopic completion, though bailout or conversion may be required; overall major-complication risk should remain low if safety principles are followed."

Score 0.3 (suggests some detachment but insufficient evidence for the required lower-third separation).\n\nFinal concise statement for Task1\nSingle instrument (fenestrated grasper) is assisting blunt traction at the gallbladder–liver bed interface during fundus/body dissection. The gallbladder appears inflamed and thickened; the hepatic bed is partially cleared with minor oozing/char, and no bile leak is seen. CVS cannot be established from this frame: cystic structures and the hepatocystic triangle are not visible, and the lower-third detachment is not demonstrated. \nCVS summary vector: [0.0, 0.0, 0.3]",

Then clip and divide the cystic artery and cystic duct with safe clip placement away from the common bile duct.\n- Complete detachment of any remaining gallbladder from the liver bed; irrigate, check for bile/bleeding, retrieve in a bag, and final inspection of the cystic plate and clips.\n- If dense inflammation obscures the view or landmarks, switch strategy to subtotal fenestrating or reconstituting cholecystectomy to avoid BDI.\n\n3) Predicted outcome\n- With continued adherence to the subserosal plane and formal CVS confirmation, high likelihood of uncomplicated laparoscopic completion with minimal blood loss; conversion or subtotal may be required if Calot’s proves hostile, but this is not evident from the present frame.\n\nFinal concise statement for Task3\nProceed with careful fundus-first dissection on the subserosal plane, maintain hemostasis and traction, and only divide the pedicle after achieving CVS; be prepared for bailout if Calot’s is hostile. This approach should allow safe laparoscopic completion with low risk of bile duct injury and minimal bleeding, based on the current field."

However, hemostasis is adequate and no critical structures are endangered in this frame, allowing safe continuation with meticulous technique.\n\nFinal Concise Statement (Task2)\nThis frame shows pre-CVS dissection in an inflamed gallbladder with a mucosal perforation and probable exposed stone, and only partial clearance of the hepatocystic triangle.

Minor bile leak risk is possible due to the gallbladder perforation but is preventable with meticulous technique.\n\nFinal Concise Statement (Task3)\nProceed with meticulous, close-to-gallbladder dissection to complete CVS, controlling the perforation and limiting thermal spread while keeping above Rouvière’s sulcus; be prepared for a subtotal or conversion if CVS cannot be safely obtained. If these steps are followed, the procedure will likely be completed laparoscopically with low bleeding and a small but manageable risk of postoperative bile leak."

    "Task1": "[Task1] Observation — step-by-step reasoning\n1) Visible instruments and actions\n- Right-hand instrument: L-hook electrocautery (white shaft, metallic hook tip) applying cautery/dissection on the anterior peritoneum over the hepatocystic triangle/gallbladder neck area.\n- Left-hand instrument: Atraumatic grasper (metallic jaws at left edge) providing lateral traction on the peritoneal edge/infundibulum region to open the triangle.\n- No assistant instrument is visible in this frame.\n\n2) Major visible anatomical structures\n- Liver surface (right lobe, cystic plate area) superiorly.\n- Gallbladder neck/infundibulum region with overlying peritoneum centrally.\n- Hepatocystic triangle soft areolar/fatty tissue (Calot’s region) being opened.\n- Definitive cystic duct or cystic artery are not clearly delineated in this single frame.\n\n3) Condition of each visible structure\n- Liver surface/cystic plate:\n  • Inflammation: none obvious; smooth capsule.\n  • Adhesions: none seen.\n  • Blood/fluids: field appears dry; no active bleeding.\n  • Other abnormalities: none apparent.\n- Gallbladder neck/infundibulum and peritoneum:\n  • Inflammation: no clear edema or hyperemia beyond normal vascular markings.\n  • Adhesions: no dense adhesions; peritoneum peels easily.\n  • Blood/fluids: no bile or blood visible; minimal surface char at hook tip only.\n  • Other abnormalities: none apparent.\n- Hepatocystic triangle areolar tissue:\n  • Inflammation: mild areolar/fatty tissue; no phlegmon.\n  • Adhesions: not evident.\n  • Blood/fluids: dry field.\n  • Other abnormalities: none.\n\n4) Anatomy State Concise Statement\nThe hepatocystic triangle appears clean with minimal tissue reaction, no adhesions, and a dry field. The peritoneum over the gallbladder neck is being opened with hook cautery; no distinct cystic duct or artery are yet identified.\n\n5) Critical View of Safety (CVS) assessment\n- C1 (Two tubular structures to gallbladder): Not achieved; two separate structures are not visible. Score 0.1.\n- C2 (Triangle cleared/exposed): Partially achieved; anterior leaf is being opened with reasonable exposure but not fully skeletonized.

Score 0.1.\n\nTask1 — Final concise statement\nHook cautery (right hand) is opening the anterior peritoneum of the hepatocystic triangle while a grasper (left hand) provides lateral traction on the infundibulum/peritoneal edge. Visible anatomy includes the liver surface/cystic plate and the gallbladder neck region without evident inflammation, adhesions, or bleeding.

    "Task2": "[Task2] Insight — step-by-step reasoning\n1) Surgical context (phase/step/state)\n- Phase: Dissection of Calot’s triangle.\n- Step: Opening the anterior peritoneal layer over the gallbladder neck and beginning to clear the hepatocystic triangle.\n- State: Early-to-mid dissection; structures not yet fully identified or skeletonized; CVS incomplete.\n\n2) Clinical interpretation (patient safety and progression)\n- Tissue conditions are favorable: minimal inflammation, good exposure, and a dry field.\n- Main safety concern is misidentification while dissecting before two structures are defined; careful, gallbladder-side dissection will keep bile duct injury risk low.\n- Progression appears controlled and appropriate for this stage.\n\nTask2 — Final concise statement\nThis frame shows early-to-mid Calot’s triangle dissection with anterior peritoneal opening and lateral traction on the infundibulum; the cystic duct and artery are not yet defined. The field is clean and dry, suggesting favorable operating conditions, but CVS remains incomplete, so careful gallbladder-side dissection is essential to maintain safety. \nBDI_RISK_LEVEL=2",
    "Task3": "[Task3] Future Plan and Outcome Prediction — step-by-step reasoning\n1) Key points of caution/avoidance\n- Stay on the gallbladder side of the cystic plate; avoid medial/deep dissection toward the common bile duct.\n- Use short, precise cautery bursts; avoid thermal spread to unseen structures.\n- Maintain consistent lateral-inferior traction on the infundibulum to open the triangle.\n- Do not clip or divide until two distinct tubular structures are clearly skeletonized 360° and the lower gallbladder is partly off the liver bed.\n- If anatomy remains unclear: pause, decompress gallbladder or switch to posterior dissection, consider ICG or IOC, or adopt fundus-first approach.\n\n2) Detailed action plan\n- Continue anterior peritoneal peel along the infundibulum, then open the posterior leaf to create a window.\n- Bluntly clear the hepatocystic triangle to skeletonize the cystic duct and cystic artery circumferentially; create safe windows around each.\n- Detach the lower third of the gallbladder from the liver bed to complete CVS.\n- Confirm CVS (two and only two structures). If available, verify with ICG cholangiography or IOC as needed.\n- Clip and divide the cystic artery (two clips proximal, one distal), then the cystic duct (consider IOC if indicated), then proceed with retrograde cholecystectomy off the liver bed.\n- Achieve hemostasis, check for bile leak, irrigate if needed, extract in a bag, and re-inspect the hepatocystic triangle.\n\n3) Predicted outcome\n- With current tissue quality and careful technique, laparoscopic completion is likely, with low blood loss and low risk of bile duct injury or conversion.\n\nTask3 — Final concise statement\nProceed with controlled anterior and posterior peritoneal dissection, keeping on the gallbladder side with steady lateral-inferior traction, and skeletonize the cystic duct and artery circumferentially before clipping and dividing after completing the lower gallbladder detachment to achieve CVS. If anatomy is unclear, use adjuncts or change strategy (IOC/ICG, fundus-first) rather than deep medial dissection. Outcome is expected to be an uncomplicated laparoscopic completion with minimal blood loss and very low complication risk."

Score: 0.3\n  3) Lower third of gallbladder off the liver bed: Not clearly shown; some detachment may exist but cannot be confirmed. Score: 0.4\n\nFinal concise statement for Task1:\nThis is an ongoing Calot’s triangle dissection with a grasper providing traction and monopolar cautery dividing inflamed fibrofatty tissue around the gallbladder neck and presumed cystic duct.

    "Task3": "[Task3] Future Plan and Outcome Prediction — step-by-step reasoning\n- Key points of caution/avoidance:\n  - Keep dissection on the gallbladder wall and above the imaginary line of Rouvière’s sulcus; avoid medial/deep traction toward the common bile duct.\n  - Limit monopolar energy near unidentified tubular structures; use short bursts and counter-traction to avoid collateral thermal injury.\n  - Control oozing promptly to maintain a clear view; suction/irrigation as needed.\n  - Do not clip or divide any structure until CVS criteria are met.\n  - Be ready for bailout (IOC, fundus-first approach, or subtotal cholecystectomy) if anatomy remains unclear or bleeding/inflammation worsens.\n\n- Detailed action plan:\n  1) Optimize retraction: fundus cephalad, infundibulum laterally and slightly caudally to open the triangle.\n  2) Clear the hepatocystic triangle: sharply/with low-power cautery remove peritoneum and fibrofatty tissue from the cystic duct and suspected cystic artery; create anterior and posterior windows.\n  3) Detach lower third of gallbladder from the liver bed to expose the cystic plate clearly.\n  4) Confirm CVS: visualize only two structures entering the gallbladder; verify posterior view.\n  5) Clip and divide: secure cystic artery (2 proximal, 1 distal) then cystic duct (e.g., locking clip with additional proximal clip) once clearly identified; avoid excessive cautery on the duct.\n  6) Complete gallbladder separation from liver bed with hemostasis; retrieve in bag; irrigate and check for bleeding/bile leak.\n  7) If unclear anatomy persists: perform intraoperative cholangiography, switch to fundus-first or subtotal fenestrating/reconstituting cholecystectomy, or convert to open as needed.\n\n- Predicted outcome:\n  - With careful dissection and adherence to CVS, likely uncomplicated laparoscopic completion with low risk of bile duct injury or significant bleeding; small risk of minor oozing or postoperative bile leak if ductal handling is difficult.\n\nFinal concise statement for Task3:\nProceed with meticulous clearance of the hepatocystic triangle, staying on the gallbladder wall, creating anterior and posterior windows, and detaching the lower third of the gallbladder to obtain CVS before any clipping or division; use minimal cautery and maintain hemostasis. If anatomy remains unclear, escalate to IOC or bailout techniques. Expected outcome is successful laparoscopic completion without major complications."
