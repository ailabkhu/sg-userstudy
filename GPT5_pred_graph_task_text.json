Maintain safe traction and limit thermal spread near the triangle; if CVS remains unobtainable, employ a bailout. Expected outcome is successful laparoscopic completion without bile duct injury if these steps are followed."

Although the scene graph proposes a “cystic_duct” node, the visual frame does not show a distinct tubular structure to confirm this.\n\n4) Structure-by-structure state\n- Gallbladder:\n  -- Inflammation: yes.

Action in this frame: positioning/aligning; no clip deployment is visible. The user hand (left hand vs assistant) cannot be determined from this single frame.\n\n2) Major anatomical structures visible and detailed description\n- Gallbladder (infundibulum/Hartmann’s pouch) (node0): Thickened, edematous, hyperemic surface with raw, dissected serosa. Inflammation: present (hyperemia, edema). Adhesions: present as inflammatory/fibrous strands around the infundibulum and Calot’s area. Blood/fluids: fresh blood and oozing on and around the infundibulum.

Inflammation: present. Adhesions: present; tissue planes are not fully cleared. Blood/fluids: active oozing obscuring some detail. Other: no clear window fully developed.\n- Cystic duct (nodes 3/7/9 with moderate–low confidence): A tubular structure leading from the infundibulum is partly visible but not completely skeletonized; exact borders are obscured by tissue and blood. Inflammation: periductal edema. Adhesions: periductal bands present. Blood/fluids: blood present in field. Other: duct diameter and course cannot be reliably defined from this frame.\n- Cystic artery (nodes 5/6 with low confidence): A likely arterial structure is suggested near the triangle but is not clearly isolated or skeletonized. Inflammation: present. Adhesions: yes. Blood/fluids: oozing in the region, no pulsatile bleeding. Other: not clearly identifiable as a single discrete vessel in this image.\n- Liver surface/cystic plate (node10, low confidence): Limited segment of liver surface seen; the cystic plate is not clearly exposed. Inflammation: mild congestion adjacent to the gallbladder. Adhesions: attachments persist. Blood/fluids: small blood film present. Other: none evident.\n\n3) Anatomy State Concise Statement\nThe infundibulum and Calot’s triangle show acute inflammatory changes with oozing and incomplete tissue clearance.

If inflammation prevents CVS, a safe bailout (subtotal) may be needed; risk of BDI stays low if the above strategy is followed.\n\nFinal concise statement for Task3\nProceed by improving exposure, clearing blood, and completing near-gallbladder dissection to skeletonize the cystic duct and artery, then detach the lower third of the gallbladder to achieve CVS before any clipping. If CVS remains unattainable, adopt a bailout (fundus-first or subtotal) rather than risk misidentification; a successful laparoscopic completion is likely with these precautions."

    "Task2": "[Task2] Insight Based on Task1 — step-by-step reasoning\n- Surgical phase/step/state:\n  - Phase: Dissection of Calot’s triangle for identification of cystic structures.\n  - Step: Anterior peritoneal peel and skeletonization of the cystic duct; exposure not yet complete, artery not yet defined; no clips applied.\n  - State: Progressing but incomplete CVS.\n\n- Clinical interpretation (patient safety and progression):\n  - Anatomy is becoming clearer but still insufficient for safe clipping; lack of a clearly separate cystic artery and residual tissues in the triangle increase bile duct injury (BDI) risk if clipping/division proceeds now.\n  - Minor oozing is present but controlled; continuing meticulous dissection on the gallbladder side should reduce risk and enable safe achievement of CVS.\n\nFinal concise statement (Task2):\nThis frame shows ongoing Calot’s triangle dissection with partial cystic duct skeletonization and incomplete CVS. Proceeding to clip/divide now would be unsafe; further controlled dissection is needed to clearly identify the cystic artery and fully clear the triangle. \nBDI_RISK_LEVEL=3",
    "Task3": "[Task3] Future Plan and Outcome Prediction — step-by-step reasoning\n- Key points of caution and avoidance:\n  - Maintain traction/counter-traction to open the triangle; keep dissection on the gallbladder side of the cystic duct.\n  - Avoid deep medial/inferior dissection toward the common bile duct; stay above the plane of Rouviere’s sulcus.\n  - Use short, low-power hook cautery bursts; avoid thermal spread onto the cystic duct or adjacent bile ducts.\n  - Control oozing to maintain visibility; avoid avulsion of the cystic duct.\n\n- Detailed action plan (how to proceed and why):\n  1) Optimize exposure: sustained cephalad retraction of the fundus and lateral traction on the infundibulum; adjust camera to keep the triangle centered and tensioned.\n  2) Complete anterior peritoneal peel on the cystic duct and carry dissection to the gallbladder wall; then open the posterior peritoneal layer to complete circumferential skeletonization of the cystic duct.\n  3) Identify and skeletonize the cystic artery separately from the duct; clear fibrofatty tissue until two distinct tubular structures to the gallbladder are clearly seen.\n  4) Verify CVS: only two structures, cleared hepatocystic triangle, lower third of gallbladder off the liver bed; document with a still image.\n  5) Once CVS is confirmed: apply clips—two proximal and one distal on the cystic artery, divide; then two proximal and one distal on the cystic duct, divide.\n  6) Detach gallbladder from liver bed in the correct subserosal plane; achieve hemostasis, irrigate, and check for bile leak; extract in a retrieval bag.\n  7) If CVS cannot be achieved safely: consider bailouts (fundus-first, subtotal cholecystectomy, intraoperative cholangiography, or conversion).\n\n- Predicted surgical outcome:\n  - With careful completion of dissection and adherence to CVS, high likelihood of safe laparoscopic completion with minimal blood loss and no bile duct injury or bile leak.\n\nFinal concise statement (Task3):\nProceed with controlled anterior and posterior peritoneal dissection on the gallbladder side to fully skeletonize the cystic duct and identify the cystic artery, maintaining traction/counter-traction and minimizing thermal spread. After confirming CVS, clip and divide artery and duct sequentially, then complete gallbladder detachment and hemostasis; the expected outcome is uncomplicated laparoscopic completion without BDI."
